# Idea One: 

For constant Uber or Lyft users or even both, it is really inconvenient to open both apps to compare the price when traveling. As a result, we figure that if there is a web application that can compare multiple taxi booking app at the same time, it will save a lot time for the users. Google map has similar idea, but we decide that there should be more app to compare since other taxi booking apps grow rapidly. If this web application is developed successfully, we believe it will have users more than Uber’s and lyft’s.  
 
 # Idea Two:
 
 <h1>...</h1>
 
 
 
 
<h3>Software Specification </h3>

For both applications we will be using a MERN STACK:
<ul>
  <li>M : Our data base solutions will be non-relational. We will be using MongoDB </li>
  <li>E : Backend frame work will be Express 4.16.2 </li>
  <li>R : For some portions of our frontend we will be using React </li>
  <li>N : We will be using javascript in the back end </li>
</ul>
<h4> Authentication </h4>
We plan to use Google's Oauth API to log in users. Thankfully google has a Node libraries on NPM that we can use <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/" > Source </a>

<h4> API's </h4> 

<b> Car Service Comparison </b>
The two biggest API's we plan to use for this project is <b> Lyft's and Uber's </b>. With the help of Google Maps to create visual aids. 

<b> Uni-Report </b>
There are some API's that can provide general college statistics: College Scorecard Data.
For other user created data sets we should use API's including Rate My Professor.
And Yelp's public API for non academic data.
